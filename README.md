Using Cheerio and mongo_db. I scrapped the german shepherd subreddit for the title, link, and image of "hot" posts. The web app I build will store the scrape in the mongo databse and retrve information to construct the home page. The web app allows for saved posts and a comment section. Models were created useing mongoose.
